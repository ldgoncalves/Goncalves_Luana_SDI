//Dog Years: Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”

// Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.

var humanYears = 5; //this is Sparky's age is human years

var dogYears = 7;

//multiply humanYears and dogYears to get Sparky's age.

var sparkysAge = humanYears * dogYears;

//prinout Sparky's age

console.log("Sparky is " + humanYears + " human years old which is " + sparkysAge + " in dog years.");

//Slice of Pie part 1
// A bunch of students are having a party and somebody ordered pizza. Create an expression that calculates how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party.  (Assume all pizzas have the same number of slices and that the person dividing the pizza is really precise, so this can be a decimal, like 3.52 slices, etc.)
